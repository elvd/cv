    \item[Degree Overview] %\textit{Quantum Barrier Devices for Sub-Millimetre Wave Detection}\\
	My aim was to study the use of resonant-tunnelling diodes in sub-harmonic mixers operating at millimetre-wave frequencies. I performed circuit modelling and simulations using Keysight ADS and Ansys HFSS, in addition to semiconductor device modelling using Matlab and Python. Fabricated devices and circuits in a cleanroom environment, and measured their characteristics up to 110 GHz using an on-wafer probe station and HP 8510C VNA. I also designed waveveguide housing blocks and components in SolidWorks. Throughout the entire time I worked in close collaboration with academics, technical support staff and fellow research students, to ensure smooth and correct work flow. 
%
%    The project aim was to study the use of specific quantum barrier devices as a non-linear element in sub-harmonic mixers operating at millimetre and sub-millimetre frequencies. The devices were further investigated for their application in amplifiers at the same frequency ranges. To address this goal, I performed circuit modelling and simulations using Keysight ADS and Ansoft HFSS, in addition to semiconductor device modelling using Matlab and Python. Fabricated devices and planar circuits in a cleanroom environment, and designed waveveguide blocks and circuits in SolidWorks for manufacture by conventional mechanical means. Throughout the entire time I worked in close collaboration with academics, technical support staff and fellow research students, to ensure smooth and correct work flow. 
%    \item[Skills gained] \hfill \\
%    Improved analytical, modelling and numerical skills as a result of research project. Practised presentation and communication skills via attending research conferences and networking with other researchers. By approaching the PhD from a project management perspective, gained good task and time management skills, never missing a deadline. Kept up-to-date with current developments in the general field through webinars and academic and trade journal subscriptions. Attended training courses in microwave measurements offered by equipment vendors, and successfully sat examination for Certified LabVIEW Associate Developer. Furthermore, through training courses at the University of Leeds and elsewhere honed Python and FORTRAN knowledge and applied that to the research project in order to streamline and speed up data processing.

%I am writing to you in order to put forward my application for the recently advertised position of \textit{Research Fellow in the Modelling, Design and Measurement of Wireless Communications Systems}. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Microwaves and Photonics, working on THz Backward Wave Oscillators. 
%
%I firmly believe that my knowledge and expertise in the field of high frequency electronic engineering, combined with my background in wireless communications, make me a suitable candidate to deliver excellent results and outputs for this project. I hope that I will be able to continue to do research at the University of Leeds, which with its world-class facilities and laboratories, along with a thriving and stimulating research environment, is the perfect place to pursue a research career in microwave and millimetre-wave engineering.
%
%My long-standing professional interest has been in RF and microwave engineering, pursuing degrees in the field at both undergraduate and postgraduate level. Having designed and worked with various microwave and millimetre-wave circuits and components during my studies and work, I have developed a deep understanding of their application and potential benefits to multiple areas, including mobile and satellite communications, and for ubiquitous sensor connectivity as part of the Internet of Things.
%
%During both my PhD and current research projects, I have extensively used, and as a result become proficient in, various software tools for microwave circuit design, modelling, and validation. I have used the 3D FEM simulator Ansoft HFSS for applications such as antennas, planar mixer and amplifier circuits, and waveguide couplers and filters. I have also used Keysight ADS for semiconductor device modelling and linear and non-linear circuit design and simulation. I have further been involved in waveguide block design for manufacture, using SolidWorks, for the purposes of investigating sub-millimetre wave finline circuits, and as a test fixture for Slow Waveguide Structures.
%
%I have complemented this work with vendor-provided training on microwave and millimeter-wave measurements, using a wide range of equipment, such as signal generators, vector network analysers, oscilloscopes, spectrum analysers, and power metres. Furthermore, I have developed my skills and knowledge in the area of measurements by becoming a LabVIEW Certified Associate Developer, and applying my LabVIEW skills to semiconductor device measurements.
%
%Being part of a vibrant Institute with established research teams, I have been able to participate and contribute to discussions between peers and partners on a variety of topics. I have also assisted in both undergraduate and MSc students' project supervision, something I thoroughly enjoy and would be happy to do again. Furthermore, I seized the opportunity to participate in outreach activities, giving a talk during the recent Be Curious festival, and receiving an invite to speak to PhD students about my experience.
%
%I am really excited at the possibility to conduct research at the forefront of microwave and millimetre-wave engineering, and given the opportunity, I am confident that I will make a significant contribution to the project, helping to deliver its expected outcomes through hard work and dedication. 
%
%Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.
